# Leader Election in Distributed Systems using Redis

A simple implementation of the Leader Election pattern using Redis for electing a leader in a multi-node cluster (distributed system) for ensuring only one instance (the Leader) will process the work (maybe the scheduled task or maybe
coordination between different services etc.)

## Solutions

Implementing leader election can be done using different approaches:

- **ZooKeeper**:

- Use ZooKeeper as the coordination service provides high reliability.

- **Spring Cloud Kubernetes**:

  If the application is deployed in Kubernetes, we can use its native leader election capabilities via Spring Cloud
  Kubernetes.

- Custom Leader Election with **Redis**:

  Redis is a lightweight and simple leader election in smaller-scale systems. It has SETNX (set if not exists) command
  we can use it for leader election.

### Selected Solution

For simplicity, we will implement leader election using **Redis**

---

## Technologies

This project is created using the following technologies:

1. Java 21
2. Maven Dependency Management
3. Spring Boot:
    - Spring Web
    - Spring Data Redis
5. Lombok
6. Redis

---

## Prerequisites

- [Java 21](https://jdk.java.net/21/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

---

## Getting Started

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SayedBaladoh/Leader-Election-in-Distributed-Systems-using-Redis-ZooKeeper-Spring-Cloud-Kubernetes.git
cd Leader-Election-in-Distributed-Systems
cd leader-election-in-distributed-system-redis
```

### **Running Locally**

#### 1. **Start Redis Locally**
Start Redis server

You can use docker
```shell
docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```
#### 2. **Update Application Configuration**

The application is configured via `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    redis:
      host: ${SPRING_REDIS_HOST:localhost}
      port: ${SPRING_REDIS_PORT:6379}
scheduler:
  cycle-time-in-minutes: ${CYCLE_TIME_IN_MINUTES:10}
```

##### Environment Variables

- `SPRING_REDIS_HOST`: Redis hostname (default: `localhost`).
- `SPRING_REDIS_PORT`: Redis port (default: `6379`).
- `CYCLE_TIME_IN_MINUTES`: Scheduler cycle time in minutes (default: `10`).

#### 3. **Build and Run**

```bash
mvn clean package
```
Run **multi instance** locally with different port,
in different terminals run:

```shell
java -jar target/leader-election-in-distributed-systems-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8081
java -jar target/leader-election-in-distributed-systems-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8082
java -jar target/leader-election-in-distributed-systems-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8083
java -jar target/leader-election-in-distributed-systems-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8084
java -jar target/leader-election-in-distributed-systems-1.0.0.jar --server.port=8085
```

Check the logs.

Try to stop the leader instance and check logs for other instance.

## Future Enhancements

- Add unit and integration test.
