# Leader Election in Distributed Systems

An implementation of the Leader Election pattern with different approaches (Redis, ZooKeeper, Spring Cloud Kubernetes) for electing a leader in a multi-node cluster (distributed system) for ensuring only one instance (the Leader) will process the work (maybe the scheduled task or maybe coordination between different services etc.)

## Solutions

Implementing leader election can be done using different approaches:

- **ZooKeeper**:

  Use ZooKeeper as the coordination service provides high reliability.

- **Spring Cloud Kubernetes**:

  If the application is deployed in Kubernetes, we can use its native leader election capabilities via Spring Cloud
  Kubernetes.

- Custom Leader Election with **Redis**:

  Redis is a lightweight and simple leader election in smaller-scale systems. It has SETNX (set if not exists) command
  we can use it for leader election.

### Implemented Solution

The implementation for the different approaches done in a separate project.
